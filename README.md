# braidnode

A dependency for deploying OTP applications onto
[braidnet](https://github.com/stritzinger/braidnet).

You don't have to work with this repository to build you own application for
braidnet. Instead, generate a new braidnode application skeleton
using [braidclient](https://github.com/stritzinger/braidclient).


## Build standalone braidnode application for braidnet
**This app can only be started as a container by braidnet.**
